This directory contains stand-alone applications to compile and run.

One example is the proxyserver and proxyclient.  The proxyserver will
create an instance of the proxy and listen on a socket on a known port for
client connections.  Proxyclient instances then connect to the proxyserver's
socket to send and receive messages from the server.  This allows one
or multiple proxyclients to execute stand-alone without needing to be 
compiled together as a single monolithic application.
