Activation is done through the Application API.  When we activate a device,
we are associating the device ID with your user account, so the device belongs
to you.

There are 2 ways we can activate a device:

  1. Activate a device directly through a mobile phone or external interface.
  
  API Documentation:
    http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/deviceRegistration
  
  Description:
    This associates the device ID + device type with your user account.
    The device must have pre-programmed in it the server address, port number,
    SSL certificates, etc.  There is no way for the server to verify the
    authenticity of the device, but the device can verify the authenticity
    of the server if SSL is used.
    
    
  2. Activate the device through the device itself
  
  API Documentation:
    http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/hubActivation
    
  Description:
    This associates the device ID + device type with your user account.
    The device doesn't have to have any server information pre-programmed
    into it, except the base URL we use to activate the device.
    The device must have SSL certificates pre-installed if SSL is to be used.
    This is the most secure method of activation. The activation request
    comes from the device itself, so the server can send back an authentication
    token to be used in every HTTP header.  The server can verify the
    authenticity of the device, and the device can verify the authenticity
    of the server, if SSL is used.
    
    
The source code in this activation directory implements Method #2 above.
It does the following:

  1. Log into the server using the given username and password
       http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/login
      
       It gets the usernamd and password from the command line interface:
        ./proxyserver -u username -p password
     
  2. Get the location ID for this user
       http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/getuser
  
  3. Download the activation key 
       http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/deviceActivationInfo
       
  4. Activate the device
       http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=appapiset/hubActivation
       
The authentication token is then stored in non-volatile memory in our 
configuration file (usually called "proxy.conf").
