This directory contains header files to be included by many other .c files
in the system.

The most up-to-date library header files are automatically copied into this 
directory after the lib directory is compiled.  Typically, applications' 
Makefiles are setup to compile the lib directory before compiling the
application itself.  It is recommended that these library header files 
not be committed to the repository since they are already being tracked 
within the /c/lib directories.
