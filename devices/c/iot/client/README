The clientsocket component is a tool that a standalone agent application
can use to connect to a proxyserver application.

If this component is compiled into your application, you must implement
the following command:

  void application_receive(const char *msg, int len);

Typically, as you can see in the exampleagent application, the message is
passed onto an XML parser which interprets People Power's XML API
and turns the message into a series of command_t's to be executed
by the user's application.
