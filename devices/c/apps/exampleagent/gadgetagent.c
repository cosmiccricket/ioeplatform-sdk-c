/**
 * This is an example agent which will run as a standalone application.
 * It is a template for your own code, which should save you hours of work.
 *
 * It communicates to the proxyserver application through a socket.
 * You would use this in an Linux environment where you might have multiple
 * agent applications connecting to a single proxyserver which manages the
 * communications from a single point with the cloud.
 *
 * In a different type of software architecture, not shown in this example
 * template, you could get rid of the proxyserver completely and compile the
 * proxy into your agent.  The proxyserver has a proxyagent directory which is
 * an example of this.  You would deploy an application like that directly on
 * your single device that you are managing over the internet.
 *
 * The application_send() and application_receive() functions you'll see in this
 * file let your application decide whether it should bridge communications
 * directly to the proxy which is compiled together with the agent, or
 * to a socket connected to a proxyserver application running separately.
 *
 * You can use the "renameFromGadgetToYourDevice.sh" script to customize
 * all files in this tree to your device's name. Edit the script and run it...
 *
 *
 * It is your responsibility as the developer to implement 4 things:
 *
 *   1. How will you discover your devices? This is usually completely device-
 *      dependent.
 *
 *   2. What profile information do you want to include in your hourly
 *      device heartbeats to the server? (i.e. device IP addresses, version
 *      numbers, model information, etc.)
 *
 *   3. What measurement information do you want to send to the server from
 *      each device?
 *
 *   4. What commands do you want to implement from the server?
 *
 *
 * My example agent here manages some made-up smart outlets that can
 * measure and control power to a single socket.  In my example code,
 * the devices are discovered with a SSDP mechanism, and they are
 * controllable over an HTTP RESTful interface with JSON. I tried to write the
 * code as close as possible to a real device you might encounter, but
 * this device doesn't really exist.
 *
 * The main file below is responsible for connecting to the proxyserver,
 * setting the callback listener when a command is received, and then
 * endlessly looping through all the functions.  We check the time
 * on each iteration to see if it's time to send a heartbeat, do a measurement,
 * etc.  You can add whatever functionality your device needs.
 *
 * Walk through of other files that are important:
 *   > ./gadgetagent.h
 *         This header describes global constants for your device, most
 *         importantly the device type which is registered at the server for
 *         your device.
 *
 *   > manager/gadgetmanager.h
 *         This defines a struct that tracks the state of your devices and
 *         the total number of devices we want to track.
 *
 *   > discover/gadgetdiscovery.c
 *         This is 100% defined by the developer. You must implement whatever
 *         mechanism is required to discover your devices and add them
 *         into the gadgetmanager.c
 *
 *   > manager/gadgetmanager.c
 *         This tracks all the devices under the control of your agent.
 *
 *   > heartbeat/gadgetheartbeat.c
 *         Each gadget has some static, constant data associated with it.
 *         Things like the IP address, firmware version, model number, etc.
 *         The heartbeat is a notification to the server "I am alive" that
 *         also repeats the generally non-changing information about a device.
 *
 *   > measure/gadgetmeasure.c
 *         The developer can leverage this module to grab measurements from
 *         his device and form a message using the IOT API commands to
 *         send the message onto the server.
 *
 *   > control/gadgetcontrol.c
 *         The developer will use this module to execute commands from the
 *         server
 *
 * Enjoy.
