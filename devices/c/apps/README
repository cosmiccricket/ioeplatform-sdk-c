This directory contains stand-alone applications to compile and run.

The proxyserver is one of the main applications. It compiles together with
the Internet of Things Proxy (iot/proxy) and opens a socket.  You must
activate your proxy with a valid key before it will interact with the 
cloud servers. The activation process links your username to the physical
platform that is hosting the proxyserver.

Other agents exist as standalone applications which connect to the
proxyserver's open socket.  These agents all share the single Internet
connection to the server.  There is a template called "exampleagent" which
implements a made-up smart outlet.

Contact People Power (http://www.peoplepowerco.com) for details on the key words
you would use to send measurements and receive commands from the cloud servers.
