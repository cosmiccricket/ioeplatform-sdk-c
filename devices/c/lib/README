This directory contains libraries used by modules within our 
'Internet of Things' device framework.  These libraries should compile
automatically when you compile a test or application, but you may run
make to create them manually.

After creating the libraries, be sure to place the .so's in a location
where they will be loaded by your system when you run the application.  
One way to do this is to create a symlink in your primary lib directory:

sudo ln -s -f ${SDKDIR}/c/lib/libexample.so /usr/lib/libexample.so
