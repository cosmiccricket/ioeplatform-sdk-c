This 'proxyserver' application creates a proxy instance (iot/proxy) and opens a 
socket on a known port (DEFAULT_PROXY_PORT) which allows multiple external
agent applications to all share the same proxy instance.  

Users of the proxyserver can use the clientsocket component found in iot/client 
to connect to the proxyserver's open socket.

BEFORE USING...
You must activate your proxyserver using the command: proxyserver -a [key],
where the [key] is given to you by People Power Company to bind your
physical device with your username.
