THIS IS EXAMPLE SOURCE CODE ONLY!  It doesn't actually do anything.
But you can look at it and modify it for to build your own agents that
connect physical devices to cloud services through some internet-connected
access point.

Read the comments at the top of gadgetagent.c for more details on how you can
modify this code to build your own agent.  

Also, the Makefile uses the environment variable ${IOTSDK} to define where
the iotsdk directory lives on your machine.
