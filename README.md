Features
--------
The IOEplatform architecture consists of 4 layers, brimming with industry-leading functionality. It features a unified connectivity layer, an analytics layer, a social networking layer, and a presentation layer. 

* /devices - Here you'll find open source SDK's to connect your devices. The C version is our most popular SDK for gateways, routers, set-top boxes, and end-devices.
* /uxpand - Device UI templates that snap right into the iOS, Android, and web apps "Presence by People Power"
* /uxtract - IOT apps running on the IOEplatform to enable new features and services to Internet-connected products!

Here's more about the capabilities of the IOEplatform...


Unified Connectivity Layer
--------------------------
The connectivity layer is manufacturer- and protocol-agnostic, which means the IOEplatform can connect anything that’s Internet-connected (and even some things that aren't!). The IOEplatform connects not only to multiple physical and software protocols, but also enables cloud-to-cloud integrations to deliver analytics, social networking and presentation layers on top of third-party cloud connectivity platforms. The unified connectivity layer converges the languages spoken by connected products into a single language, to share context and communications. An open source C-based SDK is available to drop in connected end-devices, gateways, set-top boxes, and routers to bring instant connectivity with the IOEplatform.

The patent-pending UXist™ technology and design provides the best out-of-box experiences by enabling manufacturer's products to snap into user accounts in a single step.

All of our API's are open. In addition, we are the pioneers of the Department of Energy Green Button standard for connecting metered data.


Analytics Layer
---------------
The IOEplatform truly pushes the boundaries for analytics and context for the Internet of Everything, with powerful UXpect™ and UXtract™ modules.

UXpect™ is a powerful business logic engine, designed from the ground up to enable end-users the ability to orchestrate and automate their homes and offices using natural language rules that extend across multiple manufacturers and vendors.

UXtract™ enables first-of-its-kind apps and analytics services on top of Internet connected products. With UXtract™, manufacturers and service providers have the power to differentiate themselves from the crowd and generate new streams of revenue by adding new features, behaviors, and services on top of their Internet-connected products using a powerful scripting language everyone knows and loves. UXtract™ represents the future of the Internet of Everything.

In addition, user and usage analytics are collected directly in the platform to help manufacturers and service providers identify active and non-active users, measure retention rate, and eliminate bottlenecks in end-user sales.


Social Networking Layer
-----------------------
Your home is part of a community. Very powerful use cases and behavioral shifts can occur when a home is viewed in the context of the greater community that surrounds it. We believe any solution that doesn’t address this fact simply isn’t good enough.

It all starts with UXhibit™, the analysis and segmentation of a user base into similar geographies, attitudes, beliefs, and values. UXhibit™ is able to target highly identifiable users with highly targeted communications for maximum audience impact and efficiency.  

Then we add UXcite™, a dynamic engagement engine that enables behavior change in large populations while keeping users coming back for more. Leveraging behavioral and social psychology research from groups like Stanford ChangeLabs and Arizona State University, UXcite™ is the catalyst for large-scale transformations.
The IOEplatform also captures and prioritizes feedback from the crowd. This is an invaluable tool for agile product and services development.


Presentation Layer
-----------------
With UXpand™, the IOEplatform product UI's are customizable and expandable by developers through a single location. Simply snap a new product into the platform's connectivity layer, and instantly begin managing and demonstrating that product over iOS, Android, and Web interfaces. 

And to help complete the productization efforts, the UXplain™ architecture provides customizable web and mobile interactive installation manuals, setup guides, and FAQ's for each device.  The probability a user will recommend a new product is proportional to how easy it is to install, and UXplain™ takes care of it all.


IOEplatform Command Center
--------------------------
Of course, no Internet of Everything platform would be complete without a way to manage the user base. That's why the IOEplatform provides the Command Center, a web-enabled user management system with plug-in modules to customize its functionality. The Command Center supports the Tier-1 Technical Support Module to find and fix problems, the Device Management Module to manage accounts like a property manager, the Engagement Module to engage communities and influence large-scale behavior change, and the Enterprise Module to manage hundreds of devices simultaneously across a building or campus.
