"IOT" stands for the "Internet of Things".

This Software Development Kit is a set of tools and applications to connect
things to the Internet, and is sharpened to connect to People Power's
cloud servers to expose devices in the physical world to people through
the Internet.

The C-based implementation of this IOTSDK exists now. This is designed
to run mostly on Linux and embedded-Linux systems which are typically found
connecting things to the Internet today.  We placed this implementation in a 
c/ directory to keep it separate from other languages which may implement
the same behavior.

the Internet.
